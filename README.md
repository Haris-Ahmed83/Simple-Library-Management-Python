# Simple Library Management System in Python

This is a **beginner-friendly console-based library management system** built using Python. It simulates a library environment where users can **view, add, delete, and borrow books**.

## Features
- **View all books:** See all available books in the library.
- **Add books:** Dynamically add new books to the library.
- **Delete books:** Remove books when needed.
- **Borrow books:** Borrow books and optionally borrow multiple books in one session.
- **Interactive menu:** Easy-to-use menu-driven interface.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Beginner Level)
- Console-based program
- Core programming concepts: lists, loops, conditionals, and user input

## Learning Outcomes
- Managing **dynamic data** using lists
- Implementing **menu-driven programs**
- Practicing **conditional logic** and **loop control**
- Input validation and case-insensitive handling
- Building small, practical projects simulating real-world applications

## Future Improvements
- File handling to **save and load books**
- Include book details: author, category, publication year
- GUI using Tkinter for better user experience
- Search feature for quick book lookup
